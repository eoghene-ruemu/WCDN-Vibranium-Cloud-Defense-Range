# Findings  
## Vibranium Cloud Defense Range  
### Governance • Compliance • Cloud Security Posture Assessment

This findings report summarizes the results of a comprehensive cloud governance and compliance assessment performed on behalf of The Compliance Collective. The focus of this engagement was to evaluate cloud security maturity, operational readiness, risk exposure, and alignment with recognized security and compliance frameworks.

## 1. Overall Security Posture and Maturity Score

The environment displayed strengths in organizational awareness, policy development, and leadership involvement. However, gaps were identified across governance maturity levels, operational controls, and technical implementation.

### **Overall Maturity Rating: Developing → Defined**
- Governance structures exist but require formalization.
- Processes are documented inconsistently.
- Monitoring and alerting are present but not fully operationalized.

## 3. Key Gaps Identified

### **3.1 Lack of Standardization**
- Policies and procedures are documented but not consistently enforced.
- Control execution varies across teams and functions.
- No central repository for security documentation.

### **3.2 Monitoring & Visibility Gaps**
- No unified dashboard for cloud monitoring.
- Alerts are not standardized.
- Limited cross-correlation of security events.

### **3.3 Governance Weaknesses**
- Incomplete onboarding/offboarding process documentation.
- Segregation of duties is informal and inconsistently applied.
- No formal governance board or risk committee structure.

### **3.4 Access Management Concerns**
- Inconsistent access review processes.
- No recurring schedule for privilege audits.
- Limited MFA enforcement (depending on role).

### **3.5 Risk Register Gaps**
- Lack of centralized tracking of security risks.
- No formal prioritization system.
- Some risks repeated across categories due to lack of consolidation.

---

## 4. Compliance Findings  
### **Frameworks Mapped**
- SOC 2 TSC  
- CIS Critical Security Controls  
- NIST CSF  
- Internal enterprise requirements  

### **4.1 SOC 2 Control Alignment**
**Gaps included:**
- Incomplete logical access reviews  
- No documented vendor risk assessment process  
- Limited audit trail analysis  
- Incident response plan lacking finalization  

**Strengths included:**
- Availability commitments understood  
- Change management exists, though informal  
- Organizational mission defined and adhered to  

---

## 5. Risk Assessment Results  
A structured risk analysis was performed using likelihood × impact scoring.

### **High-Risk Issues**
- Insufficient onboarding/offboarding formalization  
- Lack of enforced IAM minimum standards  
- Absence of centralized logging correlation  
- Weak vendor and third-party oversight  

### **Moderate-Risk Issues**
- Process inconsistencies across teams  
- No recurring access certification  
- Limited disaster recovery testing  
- Incomplete incident response program  

### **Low-Risk Issues**
- Documentation formatting inconsistencies  
- Verification delays in reported strengths  
- Limited staff cross-training  

---

## 6. Incident Response Readiness Findings

### **Strong Indicators**
- Organizational awareness of escalation flows  
- Interest in security tooling  
- Initial playbook outlines exist  

### **Gaps Identified**
- No test evidence of IR plan execution  
- No defined RACI during incidents  
- Lack of containment and eradication documentation  
- No tabletop or simulation exercises recorded  

IR readiness is currently **Developing**, not yet **Managed**.

---

## 7. IAM & Access Control Findings

### **Strengths**
- Users understand authentication expectations  
- Some structure around role assignment  

### **Findings / Gaps**
- No quarterly access review  
- No formal mapping of RBAC  
- Inconsistent MFA coverage  
- Privilege increases not consistently documented  

IAM is one of the largest risk areas and requires structured, repeatable processes.

---

## 8. Logging, Monitoring & Detection Findings

### **Strengths**
- Organizational awareness of need for visibility  
- CloudTrail concepts understood  
- Some logs available for review  

### **Gaps**
- No standardized alerting pipeline  
- No SIEM or central log aggregation  
- Monitoring not tied to compliance requirements  
- No documented process for responding to alerts  

Monitoring posture is **Developing**, with moderate risk.

---

## 9. Team & Organizational Maturity Findings

### **Observed Strengths**
- Team cohesion is excellent  
- High adaptability and willingness to learn  
- Motivation and unity across mission and values  
- Leadership supports growth  

### **Observed Gaps**
- Decision-making relies heavily on individual knowledge  
- Not enough operational process formalization  
- Communication structure could be refined  

These findings align with a team in transition from **Developing → Defined** maturity.

## 10. Summary of Major Recommendations

### **10.1 Governance**
- Formalize policies into a single source of truth  
- Establish a governance and risk committee  
- Standardize onboarding/offboarding workflow  

### **10.2 IAM**
- Enforce MFA across all privileged accounts  
- Establish RBAC with documented roles and permissions  
- Launch quarterly access certification  

### **10.3 Monitoring**
- Implement SIEM or cloud-native log aggregation  
- Build dashboards and alerting runbooks  
- Adopt continuous monitoring aligned with NIST Detect  

### **10.4 Risk**
- Develop a unified risk register  
- Rank risks by severity  
- Use risk owners and deadlines  

### **10.5 Compliance**
- Align controls to SOC 2 TSC explicitly  
- Document evidence collection procedures  
- Integrate change management with approval tracking

## Conclusion  

The Vibranium Cloud Defense Range assessment found that The Compliance Collective possesses strong foundational security culture, leadership support, and policy groundwork. However, several gaps remain in governance maturity, operational consistency, IAM hygiene, monitoring visibility, and risk formalization.

This assessment provides a structured roadmap to transition from a **Developing** maturity level to **Managed** and onward toward **Optimized**, strengthening the organization’s readiness for future audits, compliance evaluations, and real-world security operations.
